### Known limitations

1. This app is still young and not broadly tested. **Please use it with extreme care if it's on a prod server**
2. The app requires [Dex app](https://github.com/YunoHost-apps/dex_ynh) to be installed (Dex installation and setup is automatic, though)
3. The app is requiring two domains including one fully dedicated (one for Dex, one for Outline)
4. Because it's built from sources, the app requires an important amount of RAM, disk and time to install properly
